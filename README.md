# Google-Stock-Price-Prediction

## The objective of this project is to create a time series model to predict the tred of Google Stock price for the month of January 2017

This is achieved by creating a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) with four LSTM layers to address the vanishing gradient problem and dropouts to avoid overfitting. This model is trained over 100 epochs.
